# Variables

## Variable definition
Variable are defined with:
 - var - Hoists the definition to the top of the context
 - let - Declares a variable scoped to the current braces that can have its value changed
 - const - Declares a variable scoped to the current braces that can *not* have its value changed
## Variable names
Variables are defined with a name that must:
 - start with a character
 - can include numbers and some symbols
 - must not be a reserved word

## Primative vs Reference values
Variables in javascript can be either primative values or reference values.
## Primative values
These include:
 - number - i.e. `100`, `50.2`
 - boolean - i.e. `true` or `false`
 - string - i.e. `'My string'`
 - `undefined` and `null`

Primative variables hold a value directly. Updated a reference to another variable does not change its value.
```javascript
  let a = 0;
  let b = a;
  b = 1;
  console.log(a); // a is 0
  console.log(b); // b is 1
```

## Reference values
These include:
 - array - i.e. `let a = ['element 0', 'element 1', 'element 2']`
 - object - i.e. `let b ={key: 'value', another: 'ok', 'a-name': 'cool'}`
 - function - i.e. ` let c = function () { console.log('hello'); }`

Reference variables hold a reference to specific place in memory. Updating a reference of a reference will update all values.
```javascript
  let a = [];
  let b = a;
  b.push('1');
  console.log(a); // a is ['1']
```
