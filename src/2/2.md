# Arrays and Objects
Arrays and Objects are reference variables.

## Objects
All none primative variables in javascript inherit from the root Object class. \
Objects are created with curly brackets `{}` or with the `new` keyword depending on requirements.

```js
  let a = {
    b: 'c'
  };

  let d = new Date();
```

### Object properties and methods
Properties and methods of objects can be accessed using the reference plus dot plus property/method name.

```js
  // console is an already defined global object with serveral useful methods
  console.log('something'); // log outputs to the console
  console.error('oh no'); // error output to the console in red
  console.count('noOfTimes'); // outputs the total amount of times count as been invoked
```

## Arrays
Arrays are collections of information. Arrays in javascript are zero based i.e. the first element in an array is referenced with 0.

```js
  let a = []; // This is an empty array
  let b = [0, 1, 2]; // This array contains 3 elements: 0, 1 and 2
```

To access an element in an array, square brakets plus the index number is used.
```js
  let a = ['tree', 'ball', 'dog'];
  console.log(a[0]); // Outputs tree
  console.log(a[1]); // Outputs ball
  console.log(a[1 + 1]); // Outputs dog
```

There are a number of built in useful methods available to arrays including:
  - `myArray.push('plane');` - Pushes a new element on the end of an array
  - `myArray.pop()` - Removes the last element from an array
  - `myArray.length` - This property holds the lenth of the array
